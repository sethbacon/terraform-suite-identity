package identity

// Mutation self-test for the "Breaking-change footers survive the squash" job
// in .github/workflows/pr-checks.yml.
//
// It lives beside docs_drift_test.go for the same reason that file does: this
// package is where mechanical checks over the repository's own configuration
// go, so that `go test ./...` reaches them. The rule of thumb there — if some
// file in the repo is the real source of truth for a claim, assert against it
// rather than trusting the claim — applies here too, and the claim under test
// is "this merge gate still decides something".
//
// That guard decides whether a pull request may merge, and it is a bash script
// living inside YAML. actionlint checks its syntax, zizmor checks the workflow
// around it, and until this file nothing ever RAN it — so a regex edit, a lost
// `set -euo pipefail`, or a silently renamed job would leave the check
// reporting green over a script that had stopped deciding anything.
//
// HOW. The `run:` block is EXTRACTED from the committed workflow rather than
// copied into this file. A copy would drift from the thing it claims to prove,
// which is the same defect one level up. `gh` is stubbed with a script that
// prints a fixture commit history, so no network, no token and no repository
// are involved.
//
// THE CASE THAT MATTERS is fail-closed, and it is the only one a lost
// `set -euo pipefail` fails. Without that line the failed `gh api` still
// creates an empty commits.ndjson through the redirect, the loop counts
// nothing, and the job prints "Breaking-change declarations in this PR: 0" and
// exits 0 — a required-shaped check that has stopped looking, and
// indistinguishable from a clean pull request. Every other case here runs
// against a `gh` that succeeds, so none of them can see it.
//
// VACUITY. If the job, or its `run:` block, cannot be found, this test FAILS.
// A self-test that quietly passes over a guard it could not locate is the
// failure mode it exists to prevent.
